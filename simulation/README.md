The "Basics" Series is more like what you might learn in an introductory university course in hypothesis testing. 

On the other hand, the "Topic" series is meant to cover more intermediate topics (that's the intention, anyway) that might require being more familiar with the literature to write about. This doesn't mean that the "Topic" series topics are more "difficult" than the Basics series necessarily, but people will on average be more familiar with the contents of the "Basics" series than the "Topic" series.

If you have any feedback, *please* feel free to let me know. After all, one motivation for posting this public is that getting feedback tends to be incredibly beneficial for learning. One could even argue that I'm playing with a variation of Cunningham's Law.
