A different way of thinking about this is how many different ways can you \"choose 4\" out of 8, which is simply ${8}\\choose{4}$. If she had gotten 6 correct, we would count the number of ways you can get 6 correct (or more extreme, which is 8). However, since she got all 8 right, that is just 1 event.
